### Desciption

The client requires a software to be developed, which will simulate the Detumbling of Spacecraft in Real Time.

### Scope

The software to be developed is Satellite Detumbling Software.
The software will create a simulation of tumbled spacecraft in its orbit upon which the software will provide necessary data in real time to detumble the spacecraft. The Initial conditions of the spacecraft will be assumed by the software for creating the simulation.
